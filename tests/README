Tests
-----

The generic test code is held in test_assimilate.py.  These are pytest based 
tests.  The actual test cases are held in assimilate.nt.  This is a NestedText 
file that has the following basic structure:

    assimilate:
        ❬scenario name❭:
            initialization:
                ❬test senario❭
            tests:
                ❬test name❭:
                checks:
                    ❬checks❭

The scenarios are run in order, and then within each scenario the tests are run 
in order.  There is also a control file: run-only.nt that can be used to control 
which of the tests are actually run.

A scenario starts with an initialization phase, which is generally used to 
create the files needed for the test.  This includes the assimilate 
configuration files and any other files needed for the test.  A typical example 
is::

    druid — single config:
        initialization:
            create:
                ~/.config/assimilate/shared.conf.nt:
                    contents:
                        > encryption: none

                ~/REPO/:

                ~/.config/assimilate/test.conf.nt:
                    contents:
                        > repository: ~/REPO/{config_name}
                        > patterns:
                        >     - R ~
                        >     - - ~/.cache
                        >     - - ~/.local
                        >     - - ~/bu
                        >     - - ~/REPO

                ~/a:
                    contents: aaa
                    mtime: 2024-11-27

                ~/b:
                    contents: bbb
                    mtime: 2024-11-26

The scenario name, in this case ‘druid’, precedes the em dash.  The text that 
follows the dash is a description that is ignored.  The name is generally chosen 
at random and must be unique.  This example creates a few files, provides the 
contents of thos files, and sets the creation time.  A directory will be created 
in /tmp/pytest-of-❬username❭ for each scenario, and the files will be created 
within that directory.  The test code then sets that directory as the home 
directory, which allows assimilate to find the created configuration files.

When specifying the contents of the file, if the first character specified as 
´!’, the remainder of the contents are assumed to be a Python expression that is 
evaluated.  This can be used as a simple way to create large files.  For 
example:

    create:
        ~/nutz:
            contents: !1000*'nutz\n'

Each scenario contains a collection of tests.  For example:

        tests:
            ceasefire — create again:
                initialization:
                    remove: ~/b
                run: assimilate
                checks:
                    ~/.local/share/assimilate/test.log:
                        contains line: running command: create

The test name, in this case ‘ceasefile’, precedes the em dash, with the text 
following the dash being the description and is ignored.  The name is generally 
chosen at random and must be unique.

Each test may have an optional initialization section that can be used to create 
and delete files.  It has a run section that specifies the command to run, and 
it has a checks section that specifies checks to run on files contained in the 
working directory.  In addition, checks can be applied to stdout, stderr, and 
the exit status of the process used to run assimilate. The checks specify the 
path to the file being checked, the type of check to run, and the pattern to 
compare against.  The following type of checks are supported:

    matches text:
        The file contents must match the given pattern literally and completely.

    matches regex:
        The file contents must match the given regular expression pattern and 
        starting from the beginning of the file.

    contains text:
        The literal pattern must be found in the file.

    contains regex:
        The regular expression pattern must be found in the file.

    contains line:
        The pattern must match a line in the file literally.

    contains lines:
        The patterns must match a lines in the file literally.  The order of the 
        lines is not significant.

    contains lines in order:
        The patterns must match a lines in the file literally.  The order of the 
        lines is significant.  If an error message of:

            line missing from [❬N❭:..]

        it means that the specified line was not found in the lines that remain 
        after the previous line matched, which occurred on line number ❬N❭.

    excludes text:
        The given literal pattern must not be found anywhere in the file.

    excludes regex:
        The given regular expression pattern must not match anywhere in the 
        file.

    excludes line:
        No line in the file much match the pattern literally.

    excludes lines:
        No line in the file much match any of the given patterns literally.

You may have multiple checks applied to the same file, and the checks may be of 
the same type.  For example:

    checks:
        ~/.local/share/assimilate/test.log:
            contains regex: ^running command: list$
            contains regex: ^        aid:{aid0}[a-f0-9]+$

When specifying lines (contains lines, contains lines in order, excludes line), 
the lines may be given as a list or as a multiline string.  If given as 
a multiline string the split into a list at the line breaks.

Regular expression patterns may contain named sub-patterns.  The text matched by 
those sub-patterns may be used in subsequent regular expressions.  For example:

    unplug — repo-list:
        run: assimilate repo-list
        checks:
            stdout:
                matches regex:
                    > 1   aid:(?P<aid1>\w+)  (?P<ar1>[^ ]+)   .*
                    > 0   aid:(?P<aid0>\w+)  (?P<ar0>[^ ]+)   .*

In this regular expression 4 named subexpressions are defined, aid0, ar0, aid1, 
and ar1.  Those then become macros that can be used in subsequent commands and 
patterns.  For example:

    canyon — delete:
        run: assimilate delete -a aid:{aid3}
        checks:
            ~/.local/share/assimilate/test.log:
                contains text:
                    > running:
                    >     borg \
                    >         delete \
                    >         --repo=/{run_dir}/REPO/test \
                    >         aid:{aid3}

Here {aid3} is used in the assimilate command to specify precisely which archive 
to delete, and it is used in the check pattern to assure that the correct 
archive is deleted.

This example also demonstrates another macro that is available, {run_dir}.  This 
macro contains the path to the working directory without its leading slash.

If you need to match literal patterns that contain braces you can use ⟪ and ⟫ as 
a substitute for { and }.  They are replaced after the macros are interpolated 
and so they will not be confused as interpolations.  If you do not use ⟪ and ⟫, 
you will need to double up the braces to escape them.  For example:

            druggist — setting archive:
                run: assimilate setting archive
                checks:
                    stdout:
                        matches regex:
                            >                    archive: ⟪host_name⟫-⟪user_name⟫-⟪config_name⟫-⟪⟪now⟫⟫
                            >            ❬when resolved❭: .*-test-⟪now⟫


Coverage
--------

The tests run *assimilate* as a subprocess, which interferes with coverage data 
collection.  To work around this, a site-customize.py file is placed on the 
PYTHONPATH that initiates *coverage* within the *assimilate* process.  Then, 
environment variables are specified in tox.ini to tell *coverage* where it can 
find it rc file and where it should place the collected data.  Finally, call 
*coverage combine* before generating the coverage report.
