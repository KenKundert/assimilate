Releases
========

*Assimilate* is suitable for use with *BorgBackup* version 2.0 or later.  For 
earlier versions of *Borg* you should use Emborg_.

.. important::

    *Assimilate* is designed to work with *Borg Backup v2.0*.  *Borg 2.0* is 
    currently in beta release, so neither *Borg* nor *Assimilate* should be used 
    in a production setting.  *Assimilate* is currently being tested against 
    *Borg v2.0.0b20*.
